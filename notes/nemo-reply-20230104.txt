Hi,=20

thanks for your work.
I answer inline.

2002, but this one was not really based on Plan 9 IIRC.
2nd ed. was.

Never distributed, based on Plan 9 4th ed, IIRC.
2003
The man was exported as web pages from a b system, and I think it's =
buried now.

based on 2nd ed.
I think this was 2004

yep. Early 2006, although IIRC it was 2005.

This was 2006, Yes, based on both Plan B and Inferno

2007. probably.
And yes.


The Nixies were developed as a set of continuous patches from some guys =
at the labs and me and
and I dont think I have the exact dates, but they started 2013.
I think we took some code from 9atom (some drivers IIRC) and code was =
sent to others because we had
64bit support in the kernel.

I think I'd just use NIX, and forget about the marks we used to explain =
ourselves, mostly.

Well, many ideas derived from Plan 9, but not any source.


Thanks again and HTH.
